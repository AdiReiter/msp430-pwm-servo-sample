Introduction
------------

This example shows how to use TIMER_A0+A1 PWM with a MSP430G2xx3 MCU. It controls two servos on P1.6 and P2.2. 


Hardware Setup
--------------

Connect signal pins of servos to P1.6 and P2.2. Also connect GND of Launchpad to GND for servors. Supply ~5V to servos from seperate power source (do NOT power from Launchpad!). 


Compilation
------------

This project is written for msp430-gcc on Linux (I used v4.5.3 which is available as package on ubuntu). For flashing the "mspdebug" tool was used (also from the Ubuntu package).

To compile the source just issue a:

make -C src

This builds the firmware in the "src" subdirectory.


Flashing
------------

To flash the firmware to your Launchpad you could use the "flash" make target:

make -C src flash
